        <title>Week 8 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;learning-to-learn&quot;&gt;Learning to learn&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe but we are now 2/3s done with Rails Engineering at The Iron Yard. We only have one more month left and so many more things to learn. One of TIY’s sayings is that they teach you how to learn. To this end, I often see Jesse purposely not give a full answer because he wants you to bang your head a little. Make no mistake, you don’t magically learn stuff at The Iron Yard. You have to work for it. On our first day, Jesse was clear that the only way for us to learn enough to become junior dev ready in 12 weeks is to push us just beyond our comfort zone. In recognition of this, I must say, I have learned an amazing amount and I have definitely learned how to learn more efficiently. I mean, I am no &lt;code&gt;React.js&lt;/code&gt; expert but the fact that I can read and understand docs enough to build a working product (albeit simple) within a day is amazing. There is no way I could have reached this point in two months by myself. I love what TIY has helped me accomplish. I am excited what another month at TIY will bring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re still in catch up mode due to our missed days so no challenges for this week either. Today’s lecture is over consuming APIs. Basically, we are shown how to make requests to other people’s APIs and how to process the response. I think the coolest thing is learning about the some of the awesome APIs that are already out there. Jesse showed us the &lt;a href=&quot;http://deckofcardsapi.com/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;deckofcardsapi&lt;/a&gt; and you can hear everyone asking in their heads why we made &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-2-the-iron-yard-and-my-first-hackathon&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;blackjack&lt;/a&gt; from scratch. It’s funny how complicated it use to sound when I heard something like, “make an API request.” Now it’s just like, oh it’s just going to a URL and pulling a hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-36&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt; is to deploy a Rails app that will get the 10 most recent Etsy listings using the Etsy API. Solution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/etsy_api&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://joey-esty-api.herokuapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s lecture is the meat of the week. Creating an API. Rails maybe a full-stack framework but it is extremely common for it to be used just for back-end. I imagine this is because Rails makes it super easy to create an API server that spits out json data using jbuilder. To demonstrate how to create an API and why we create APIs, we created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-37/tree/master/atm&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;bank ATM API&lt;/a&gt; in class. This ATM API would be able to deposit and withdraw money from a customer’s account securely through use of a token. The main difference between a Rails API and a full-stack Rails app is that you don’t return html to the browser, but json which is really just a hash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-37&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;homework&lt;/a&gt;, we are to create a Rails API which does the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET /posts to return all posts
GET /posts/:id gives details of a post
POST /posts creates a post
PUT /posts/:id updates a post
PATCH /posts/:id updates a post
DELETE /posts/:id deletes a post
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/day-37&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is a review day. Jesse went over both using and creating an API by building two separate Rails apps, one for front-end and one for back-end. Our example for this review is an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-38&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;application for displaying books and authors&lt;/a&gt;. I know I have the tendency to gloss over reviews in my posts so let me clarify how helpful they actually are. People do not usually learn things the first time they see it. This was what I experienced a lot of when I was self-learning how to program. I would finish a tutorial and be like hah! ezpz. But when I was done, I still had trouble applying it more broadly to build something from scratch. It would take me almost a year before I could even &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/working-efficiently/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;start writing something from scratch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s vastly different to go over a scripted tutorial versus seeing a programmer (who has an aptitude for teaching) write something from scratch. You get to see the thought process, the problems that occur and how to solve them, and you get to ask questions right then and there. This has been essential to my rapid growth. Information is far more easily absorbed when I can understand why each step is taken. Even the best tutorials do not do this perfectly. This is especially important when learning something like Rails which makes a lot of assumptions about how you should program and name things. I have spent countless hours trying to figure out why something didn’t work only to realize that I didn’t name it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another vital part of being in a classroom with someone like Jesse is that you learn how to debug. The fact is that your program will almost never work the first time. You need to learn how to figure out what the problem is in a systematic way. Being able to watch Jesse run into problems and how he thinks through them has been essential to my ability to debug.&amp;lt;/rambling&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse is going to be out for the rest of the week so we get &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-8-lab&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; early this week. This week is our first paired project (kind of…). Each pair is to create an API server and a front-end to request and display that data. The app itself is basically an anonymous messaging board. It’s super cool to see group projects because this will give you a good idea of the workflow when employed as a dev. I imagine the hardest part of this lab for most pairs will simply be to effectively separate tasks/features(Trello is awesome for this) and manage their git repo. However, our Rails Engineering class has 9 people. As Jesse worded it: “Joey, you will not so randomly be working by yourself.” I am a little sad that I won’t be able to experience a paired project yet but also a little happy with his confidence in me. Either way, next week’s lab will be a group project with the front-end class so I’m not too worried about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing about separating the front-end and back-end is that we now have to think slightly differently. We now have to not only think about features but also break those features down into which parts should be back-end and which parts should be front-end. For example, when you log in a user, you need to both authenticate the user and change the UI to reflect that the user has been signed in. So we now have to break the login feature into a back-end user authentication and a front-end rendering of UI. The back-end then has to determine what info they want for authentication and what data do they need to feed back to the front-end. The front-end then has some UI and UX decisions to make with the data that was fed back. I’m glad that we get to start learning to think this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesse is out and I’m doing the lab on my own so I decided to just work from home today. The lab itself calls for a Rails back-end and a Rails front-end but I decided that I wanted to make it a little more interesting by using a JavaScript front-end framework instead, &lt;code&gt;Ember.js&lt;/code&gt;. I did a quick version of the back-end since I knew I would be spending a ton of times in Ember docs. Jesse is huge on Ember.js and I can understand why. Ember-cli makes it very similar to Rails and it took me almost no time to get a semi-working front-end. It took me less than half a day to get Ember to display my posts list, create a post, create a user, and send a request to authenticate a user. The problem came when I had to find a way to do user sessions. Theoretically, I should be able to easily use Ember Data’s &lt;code&gt;DS.store&lt;/code&gt; to hold the session data. I spent an entire day trying to get it to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt (Our Houston front-end instructor) gave me a hand and used some expert JS debugging skills to give me a solution but as I continued trying to use Ember, I realized that the session info was not persisting between page reloads. I love the idea of Ember, but I found the docs to be quite outdated. To be fair, I was probably a little too confident with my learning ability to try to learn Ember while our resident Ember.js expert (Jesse) was out. I’m sure if I were more experienced that I could figure it out but there was no way I could finish my lab before the end of the weekend at the pace I was going. And so I made the decision to put Ember on hold and at the advice of Matt, try &lt;code&gt;React.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I can say about React.js is that it has some pretty nice docs. It took me about a day but I was able to implement a basic version of the lab in React. One of the key ideas of React is the use of components. Components are basically custom made HTML elements which enjoys some custom implementations. For example, I can make a &lt;postform&gt; component and reuse it. I think of it as I think of Rails partials. The cool thing is that components are a thing in Ember too and I do plan on re-visting Ember again next week. Another key idea of React is that components should be structured in a way that data flows in a linear fashion. Basically, data should only be accessible within parent-child relationships. This was a little tough for me and I ended up cheating by not using React&#39;s &lt;code&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; but instead using &lt;code&gt;sessionStorage.setItem()&lt;/code&gt;. I think I can fix that by creating an app component and nesting but... time. I&#39;m sure that I&#39;m missing out on a lot of the React.js way of doing things, but here&#39;s my current solution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/secrets&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeypoon.com/secrets/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Site&lt;/a&gt;. The posts may take a second to load in the beginning since my back-end is on Heroku and the server will go to sleep if unused for a period of time. I am super proud of the non-existent load time when creating a new post though :).&lt;/postform&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guest speaker today is Jeff Reichman from January Advisors. I met Jeff back during the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-2-the-iron-yard-and-my-first-hackathon&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;3rd annual Houston Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; and he is big on making Houston a better place using technology. He shared with us the some amazing facts about the City of Houston government and how we as devs can help make the city a better place. The City of Houston has a huge amount of data that isn’t being utilized and as devs we are in prime position to help make the data useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also spotted Efrain, who we had as a speaker during our &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-1-the-iron-yard&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;first week&lt;/a&gt;, in the building so I checked in with him to see how his accelerator experience was going. Apparently he’s in Houston this weekend to meet with some investors. Such cool, much jealous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit that I am loving the things I can do with JavaScript. Looking at my previous Rails apps, they feel kind of clunky in terms of load times. The language itself still hasn’t made much of an impression on me but I definitely can’t live without it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was asked yesterday about how I organize my Trello boards for projects. I’m still learning and adapting but here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/VkKMuy6X/staple&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;board&lt;/a&gt; I used for &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-7-the-iron-yard&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;last week’s lab&lt;/a&gt;. It’s terrible and I’m still trying to figure out a systematic way of organizing it but the basic idea is that each card should be a feature. If I think of a feature I want, I add it to the board immediately so I don’t forget it. If I’m in the middle of working on a feature, I don’t stop and switch but just add the idea to the board and finish my current feature card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I implement a feature, I always start with the simplest implementation. In the same way, I usually work on cards in order of simplicity. If I think of something that I feel like the feature should also do, I just add a card. For example, let’s say I want a login form within a modal. Well, that’s really multiple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1: login form
2: form submission
3: processing form request
4: moving the form to a modal
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Trello, I would probably make all 4 a separate card. I’m not 100% sure on this since one can argue that a login form automatically means that you will need to have form submission. However, when programming, I would definitely create the form first and make sure that it displays before I worry about the form submission. This is a vital idea since if you implement an entire feature and it doesn’t work, it makes it harder to figure out what part of it is broken. Always get one thing working before you move on to the next part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s it for this week. As always, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to tweet &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JoeyFPoon&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;@joeyfpoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 7 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;week-of-javascript&quot;&gt;Week of JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week is the week of the all too essential JavaScript. I can’t say that I’m too fond of the language itself but I can’t deny that you can do some awesome things with JS and that it is a must learn for any web dev. I’m actually teaching myself Ember.js on the side since I plan on using ember-rails-cordova to create a mobile app in my final project. I am really starting to feel the sleep deprivation this week. Having to work while doing TIY is exhausting. Software is never finished and there is never enough time to add and fix everything you want to. I really need to work on getting to sleep earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today starts our JavaScript adventures. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-31&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt; today is to write a program that will return the worst movie provided a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-31/blob/master/movies.json&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of movies. We never formally covered JSON but I imagine Jesse gave a brief explanation on how to read a JSON file in Ruby. I was a little late this morning so I unfortunately missed out on that. Fortunately, JSONs seem simple enough to use. When you look at the file, you can see that it is just a hash so completing the challenge is just a matter of pulling out the right information. &lt;code&gt;movies.json&lt;/code&gt; provides an enormous amount of information so my first step is to use &lt;code&gt;.map&lt;/code&gt; to extract the movie titles and ratings. I can now sort the new mapped array by the ratings and simply return the first movie in the array. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-31/challenge.rb&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first JS lecture starts with a brief history on the interwebs. After history, we start playing around in jsbin. Jesse’s philosophy of learning a new language is to draw parallels to your primary language. Such was our lesson. We would write out how to do something in Ruby and then translate it into JavaScript, each time noting the differences. We covered the basics such as &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;function()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;console.log()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;alert()&lt;/code&gt;, and debugging with the inspector. We also briefly touched on &lt;code&gt;underscore.js&lt;/code&gt; which is pretty awesome because it basically gives us access to Ruby methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-31&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt; is a carbon copy of &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-1-the-iron-yard/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;day 1&lt;/a&gt; but in JavaScript. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsbin.com/zifiyemasu/edit?js,console&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncle (tropical storm)Bill didn’t want us to have class today.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/hurricane-bill.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hurricane-bill&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morning challenges are being cancelled for the rest of the week. We’ve now missed 2 days of class due to weather so we’re trying to keep up with the lectures. Straight into lecture we go!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have jQuery and remote forms in Rails. jQuery makes using JavaScript so much more bearable. Being able to get elements with &lt;code&gt;$(&#39;.className&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; as opposed to &lt;code&gt;document.getElementByClass(&#39;className&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; makes me so much happier. The number of lines of code you save using jQuery over vanilla JS makes me cry salty nerd tears. Remote forms are basically JS forms. The response is provided in JS instead of HTML. This is useful for responsive sites since you don’t have to reload the entire page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-33&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;homework&lt;/a&gt; is practice with enumerables in JavaScript. We get to cheat and use &lt;code&gt;underscore.js&lt;/code&gt; since we’re not a JS class 😀. Honestly, I considered just teaching myself to use CoffeeScript since it seems much more intuitive to my brain but I figured that I would need vanilla JS in the future. My &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsbin.com/hepekiteva/edit?js,console&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is mostly a review day. The only real addition is lots of modals and throwing remote forms into modals. Bootstrap is your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-7-lab&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Lab&lt;/a&gt; this week is building Pinterest using tons of modals and remote forms. The goal is to only refresh on login and on &lt;code&gt;root_path&lt;/code&gt;. I actually planned to speed through this lab and spend the weekend filling my brain with some more &lt;code&gt;Ember.js&lt;/code&gt; but things got complicated fast. I never used Pinterest before but researching Pinterest made me realize that it actually has a ton of features so my Trello board kept getting longer and longer. I found myself rethinking how I want to implement certain features constantly. As a result, I kept backtracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is funny how some things may seem complicated at first but once you break it down into pieces it eventually comes together. It’s one of the reasons I love programming so much. When I started planning allowing users to favorite posts, I actually ended up taking a loooooong break because the thought of the number of things I need to do just sounded like a lot when I bunched it all together. When I finally sat back down and broke it into pieces it looked simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* need a place to save favorited posts - add column to users table
* need a way to view own favorited posts - add route/action/view
* need to see a user&#39;s favorited posts - add that user&#39;s favorited posts to displayed posts
* repeat some of the above and modify for un-favoriting
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there was some debugging thrown in but the ability to break problems down into such small pieces is just such an amazing part of coding. Also praise version control. I would be way too scared to make changes to my code without &lt;code&gt;git checkout -b branch_name&lt;/code&gt;. Since I am praising things, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/github/hub&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;hub&lt;/a&gt; is an awesome addition for git. I’m not entirely happy with the number of features yet but here’s where I’m at currently for my lab: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/staple&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://joey-staple.herokuapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guest for the week is Darren Ansley. Darren comes to us today with an inspiring story of how he started from humble origins and over the years has become an amazing programmer. It is a great reminder that if you stick to your passion relentlessly, you will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With final projects closing in, Martin and I had a little planning session. It’s pretty amazing how much you can learn and the number of ideas you can get from asking others. The current iteration of my final project idea sounds nothing like my initial idea. It will be interesting to see how much more it’ll evolve in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing when I look at how much I’ve learned during my time at the Iron Yard. While it’s great that I can build more cool things now, I think what’s more amazing are the skills that I have learned along the way. One of the most important skills I have gained is definitely debugging. I mean it’s almost embarrassing when I look at my old stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/learning-rails&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; for example. I spent an entire day trying to figure out what was going on. When I look at it now, I can only slap myself for my stupidity. It had nothing to do with my JS not loading, I simply needed &lt;code&gt;$(document).ready&lt;/code&gt; since my code was loading before my window was ready. If I had simply used the inspector, I would have seen that my JS was loaded but too early. I hope that I will continue to find the stupidity in my past code 😀.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 6 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;half-way&quot;&gt;Half Way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week marks the half way point of the Houston Iron Yard Rails engineering program, made official with some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/matthiasak/status/609347338276986880&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;BBQ by our very own Dotron&lt;/a&gt;. It is unbelievable that we’re already half-way in. I have been having so much fun that I haven’t really thought about it but it is actually super scary to think about what’s going to happen in 6 weeks. Another 6 weeks from now, we are all going to be working as junior devs or starting our own companies. Will we be ready? The imposter syndrome is strong in us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh noes, a broken app! Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-26&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; today is to fix it. When you look at it, this challenge is actually really smart. I mean, as a dev, cloning the repo of a broken app and fixing it is probably quite a real and fairly common scenario. It’s also a super good exercise in teaching yourself how to troubleshoot. You clone the repo and check if it runs. It runs but you get a default Rails screen? Okay, check the routes. Routes fixed, what does localhost:3000 show now? Nothing. Okay, let’s follow the route into the controller and corresponding view. Still not working? Let’s see what console/inspector shows. Ah, can’t load bootstrap huh? application.css needs to be renamed application.scss. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-26/railsy&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;. The funny thing about this exercise is that there is barely any coding at all. It’s a good reminder that sometimes what’s broken isn’t necessarily the code but the most obvious thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agenda for the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* Session and Authentication
* has_secure_password
* simple_form
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some super important stuff today. Almost all sites require signing up and signing in so this lesson is vital. It is always cool to see how much fun it is to develop in Rails. Being able to run a secure signup with just a single method &lt;code&gt;has_secure_password&lt;/code&gt; and throwing up a form with just a couple lines of code using &lt;code&gt;gem simple_form&lt;/code&gt; makes using Rails such a joy. It’s funny how grand it sounds when you think of writing code for logging in a user when all we’re doing is something as trivial as setting &lt;code&gt;session[:user_id]&lt;/code&gt;. A great resource on the topic of user sign up is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.railstutorial.org/book/modeling_users#cha-modeling_users&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Chapter 6 of Michael Hartl’s Rails Tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No homework today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-27&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt; today is super hard to finish in fifteen minutes. We basically have to create a super naive version of Twitter. The challenge calls for a single page with a list of all tweets in descending order so I started with &lt;code&gt;rails g controller Posts index&lt;/code&gt;. Since it’s single page, I set the root to the index. Index page on &lt;code&gt;localhost:3000&lt;/code&gt; as expected. Tweets need to be stored somewhere so I went ahead with &lt;code&gt;rails g model Post content:text&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a microblog post so &lt;code&gt;validates length: { maximum: 142 }&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;Post.rb&lt;/code&gt; before I forget. Now I need a way to tweet so let’s throw a &lt;code&gt;form_for @post&lt;/code&gt; together. I want to put it at the top index so let’s make it more readable by writing the form in a partial and rendering it in index. Index is broken on localhost due to missing route as expected. Let’s add the needed route for the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;post &#39;posts&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;posts#create&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Localhost now shows missing action posts#create as expected so let’s add a create method in &lt;code&gt;posts_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt;. Now index loads but there’s no tweets showing. Better add &lt;code&gt;Post.all&lt;/code&gt; to the index action and throw an ordered loop into the view. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-27/deep_thought&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;. I’m actually super proud that I finished within the time limit 😎.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s lecture is over two very awesome gems. Carrierwave and Kaminari. Carrierwave is for image uploading and Kaminari is for pagination. With all the amazing things we have been doing with gems, we now have a joke in class that at the end of the program Jesse will tell us that we can finish our entire app with a single &lt;code&gt;rails g&lt;/code&gt; line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-27&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt; today is practicing what we’ve learned these past two days. We are to create an online photo album with login authentication required for uploading. We need a controller with a list of photos so let’s start with &lt;code&gt;rails g controller Photos index&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s set the index to the root path and since we’re in routes, add &lt;code&gt;&#39;/admin&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;photos#new&#39;, as: :new_photo&lt;/code&gt;. We will need a place to store photos so lets &lt;code&gt;rails g model Photo name&lt;/code&gt; and add Carrierwave to the gemfile and bundle. Carrierwave needs us to run a generator and mount the uploader in the model so let’s do that first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The photo index needs to be paginated so let’s add Kaminari to the gemfile and bundle. Run the Kaminari generators and update our controller so that it displays our photos. We need a way to add photos so let’s add a &lt;code&gt;form_tag&lt;/code&gt; to our &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; action. Lastly, we need to secure the upload form so let’s add a session controller, User model, and &lt;code&gt;has_secure_password&lt;/code&gt;. I don’t want new User signups so we’ll leave out a users controller and simply create a user in seeds. Solution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://joey-photo-uploader.herokuapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-27/photo_uploader&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our daily &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-28&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;morning mental stretch&lt;/a&gt; is to, given a database table, write validations for all fields, mount Carrierwave, and add relationships. There’s an added hard mode to write a getter and setter method that returns price in dollars and stores dollars into cents. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-28/challenge.rb&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture for the day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* dotenv-rails
* carrierwave-aws
* acts_as_follower
* acts_as_taggable_on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carrierwave, while awesome, stores files locally. This causes problems when you deploy through Heroku and scale beyond one. The simple solution is carrierwave-aws. carrierwave-aws allows you to easily route your Carrierwave images into your S3 account. Amazon S3 requires an access ID and secret key in order to access. As lazy programmers we definitely don’t want to type it out every time so we put it into a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file and load it by using &lt;code&gt;gem dotenv-rails&lt;/code&gt;. We can make sure to not commit it into git by adding it to gitignore. However, now Heroku is broken. Git now ignores the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file so Heroku doesn’t get a copy. Unfortunately, we have to manually add the keys to &lt;code&gt;Heroku config:set&lt;/code&gt;. On the bright side, it’s not too troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;acts_as_follower is basically a gem that simplifies the more complex challenge of allowing an object to follow another object. acts_as_taggable_on is the same but for creating category tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-28&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt; is to upgrade yesterday’s homework to use S3 for image storage and add image tagging. Solution: &lt;a href=&quot;http://joey-photo-uploader.herokuapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-27/photo_uploader&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. Basically it’s integrating carrierwave-aws, dotenv, Heroku environment variables, and acts_as_taggable_on with yesterday’s homework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our challenge today takes on the familiar form of tests. We are to write code to make these &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-29/blob/master/caffeine/caffeine_tests.rb&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; pass. The only weird part about the challenge was getting the coffee to return empty after 3 drinks. I decided to do a 0 to 1 scale so subtracting .33 * 3 wasn’t quite 0. I ended up doing an ugly if statement to set the coffee to 0. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-28/challenge.rb&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;. Jesse’s solution used a scale of 0 to 99 which I find to be more elegant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s lecture is just review. Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-6-lab&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; this week is to recreate Twitter. My solution: &lt;a href=&quot;https://joey-flatter.herokuapp.com&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/flatter&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. I apologize for not being very descriptive with my thought process for the lab, I’m pretty tired right now but I did leave a nice commit trail 😀.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guest speaker today is Mohammad Azam, senior mobile dev at blinds.com. He shared some cool knowledge of iBeacons with us. He also showed us an app he has been working on that notifies you when your luggage has arrived at the terminal. I know I’d pay money for that. Today is also the official half-way point of our program. We celebrated with some BBQ for lunch. Yum yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-things&quot;&gt;Other Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My classmates asked me a very interesting question this week - is The Iron Yard worth the money I put into it? This may seem like a strange question coming from someone else who is also currently attending TIY so let me provide some context. TIY is a 0 to 60 program. This means that they have the expectation that you have zero programming knowledge at the start of the bootcamp. There are other types of programming bootcamps. I believe Hack Reactor advertises itself as a 20 to 120 program, for example. I didn’t come into TIY at zero. I had been teaching myself programming for about a year by the time I started Rails engineering at The Iron Yard. I certainly wasn’t anything more than a novice and I certainly wasn’t good enough for a junior dev position but my time in the program so far definitely has not been too head-banging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So back to my classmates’ question. Is TIY worth the price for me? Or perhaps more generally, is TIY worth the price for someone who isn’t starting at zero? 100% yes. While I can’t deny that I probably would have been a better fit at something like the Hack Reactor, I have no regrets with choosing TIY’s program. The fact is that while I’m not banging my head, I am solidifying my programming ability. Things that worked but I had no understanding of are now making sense. Things that took hours to build or debug, now only take minutes. The direction I have received from Jesse alone has made my time at TIY invaluable to me. I certainly would not have reached my current level so soon without TIY. Unless you are already junior dev level (then you don’t need a bootcamp at all!), you will most certainly get your money’s worth at The Iron Yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you’ve probably noticed, I wrote out my thought process a little more for some of the challenges and assignments. I unfortunately didn’t have time to do all of them but let me know what you think. Is it boring? Too many words? Interesting? Tweet me &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/joeyfpoon&quot; target=&quot;\_blank&quot;&gt;@joeyfpoon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new family member is settling right in:

        <title>Week 5 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;databases-oh-my&quot;&gt;Databases, oh my&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s finally time for databases! I have been waiting for this moment. All of my ideas require databases(what doesn’t nowadays?) so I’m super excited to build some awesome database backed projects. Let’s jump right into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-21&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; of the week is a review on Rails routes. We have to define a routes file that produced a predefined set of urls. My solution &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-21/challenge/config/routes.rb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Funny thing about the challenge is that everyone in class did a full Rails app when apparently Jesse only wanted a routes file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture this week begins with an intro to postgresql and using psql. We went over the most common queries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;create table table_name (column data_type, column2 data_type);
insert into table (column, column2) values (value1, value2);
select * from table where column = &#39;value&#39;;
delete from table where column = &#39;value&#39;;
drop table table_name;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesse shared with us that this is the first time TIY Houston Rails Engineering is getting lectured over SQL queries. Some students from past cohorts told them that they wished that they had more SQL knowledge. It’s super cool to see them take feedback seriously and I’m glad that I can better understand what calling &lt;code&gt;Model.all&lt;/code&gt; in Rails actually does in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework today is completing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sqlcourse.com&quot;&gt;sqlcourse&lt;/a&gt; and creating a script to accomplish &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-21&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. My solution is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-21/sql_assignment.txt&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll note that it’s pretty important to look at your classmates’ solutions after completing it yourself. You’ll sometimes discover better ways to solve the problem. In this case, I learned that I can insert all my cities in the same statement. This would have saved me quite a number of lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-22&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; is to create a table for storing panda information. After creating the table, we have to write queries that will pull the largest male and largest female panda. My solution &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-22/pandas.txt&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture today is pretty heavy. We covered multiple tables and joins, ActiveRecord, and migrations. I think now is a good time to mention how important it is to attend meetups even if you don’t fully understand the topic at hand. Last month’s Ruby meetup had Derek Anderson introducing us to his Rails tool &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/keredson/ruby-db-evolve&quot;&gt;db:evolve&lt;/a&gt;. db:evolve allows you to update your tables by changing the schema directly. The basic premise is that it takes git diffs of the schema and updates the tables according to the differences. This method is way easier and, in my opinion, more intuitive than creating migrations. We hadn’t even touched Rails when this meetup occurred so my knowledge of the topic at the time was limited at best. Looking back at it, I can now understand how awesome this tool is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework is to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-22&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; (no scaffolding, of course). It’s a basic blog so all it needs is a &lt;code&gt;:title&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;:body&lt;/code&gt;. We need to populate the blog with seed data and it should have a working index action and show action. As an addition, we have to add a &lt;code&gt;published_on:date&lt;/code&gt; column using a migration and only display posts that are published. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/c52e656019ab2c395d152f7544fd5f59b4bbbb4d/day-22/blog&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-23&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt; for the day is to create a migration to add a column to a table and another migration to remove a column. The challenge itself wasn’t too difficult, but we did get to learn how to deal with typos and such. You can’t just change a migration file that has already been run since Rails will think that it has already run and won’t make apply the changes. You instead have to &lt;code&gt;db:migrate:down VERSION=version_number&lt;/code&gt; first. My solution &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-23/day-23/pins/db/migrate&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We covered forms and validations in lecture today. Jesse first made a form using only HTML, then he used the &lt;code&gt;form_tag&lt;/code&gt;, then he used &lt;code&gt;form_for @model&lt;/code&gt;. It’s pretty interesting to see the different methods as it helps me visualize exactly what &lt;code&gt;form_for&lt;/code&gt; does. I have actually used &lt;code&gt;form_for&lt;/code&gt; in conjunction with a &lt;code&gt;scaffold&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeypoon.com/blog/working-efficiently/&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; before and had trouble making it work without scaffold. Now I can see that I simply didn’t set up my RESTful actions properly, it’s actually quite embarrassing when I look back at it. For validations, we covered a basic presence and numericality assertion. It’s pretty cool that you can validate input with just a single line. I remember when I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/Summer_FA_Calculator&quot;&gt;manually&lt;/a&gt; did input validations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-23&quot;&gt;homework&lt;/a&gt; today is an add-on to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-22&quot;&gt;yesterday’s homework&lt;/a&gt;. We have to add the ability to create posts, edit posts, and validate all fields. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-22/blog&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sing it with me, lab day~~~lab day~~~. It’s always so exciting to see what awesome project we get to build over the weekend. Anyways, morning &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-24&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; is to write methods into the Buyer model to make the tests pass. This is our first time dealing with tests within a Rails environment so it was actually pretty difficult. I was able to get write a naive solution for checking age but I kept having issues getting the tests to pass. Eventually I noticed that the methods tested end in ? so they should return a boolean. Given our heavy use of assert_equal in the past, my brain automatically thought that the methods should return the string at the end of each test. Silly mistake. My solution &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-24/validity/app/models/buyer.rb&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last lecture of the week is over table relationships, Heroku, and flash messages. Rails again shows its awesomeness by making relationships easy to manage with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;belongs_to
has_many
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s funny how easy Heroku seems when someone walks you through it. I can’t count the amount of time it took me to deploy my first app on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for weekend fun! &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-5-lab&quot;&gt;Lab this week&lt;/a&gt; is to recreate reddit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Normal mode:
* Index of user posted links that are ranked by votes
* Votes increment when a link is clicked
* No downvotes

Hard mode:
* Downvotes
* Add relationships between User and Posts
* Allow selection of User when creating a post
* Validate link uniqueness

Nightmare mode:
* Add User sign-in
* Add testing
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I noticed when doing this project is that I tend to drift into multiple features at the same time. This leaves me with multiple half finished features and I get lost in thought. I’ve decided to start using Trello to write out features to add. I then work on them one at a time and move them to done as I go. It also helps me not forget features that I want to add. It’s working out pretty well so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One technical problem I had with this project is trying to integrate &lt;code&gt;gem devise&lt;/code&gt; into my project. I found it pretty hard to implement when I didn’t understand what it was doing and I honestly wasn’t very fond of its documentation. I ended up scrapping devise and at the same time, blowing up my project. Not knowing what devise installed made it even harder to remove all its pieces. Thank goodness for git, I just reverted back to my last working version. I still have quite a few features that I want to add to make it more reddit-like but functionality-wise, nightmare mode &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/reddit_clone&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; is complete (&lt;code&gt;has_secure_password&lt;/code&gt; is awesome). Here’s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://joey-reddit-clone.herokuapp.com&quot;&gt;live version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guest for the week is Amanda Shih from OpenStax. Amanda is super active around the Houston tech community and showed us some awesome JS robotics. She actually hooked up a robot that we could control through her server. She then walked us through the setup process. It’s pretty cool to see how simple it is to do something like get a robot to move with some of the tools that are already available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our projects are getting pretty awesome. To be able to build something like Reddit is amazing. To think that just over a month ago we wrote our first loop, it is amazing the amount of ground we have covered in such a short time. Time to get back to work 😀. See you all next week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 4 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;bittersweet&quot;&gt;Bittersweet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the end of my 4th week at TIY and it’s a strange feeling. We’ve gone from variables and arrays on day 1 to creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/surf_and_rails&quot;&gt;dynamic pages with Rails&lt;/a&gt; in less than 20 class days. With a third of the program now complete, I’m excited about what more I’ll be able to do at the end of the whole program. At the same time, I’m sad to see time passing so quickly. These 4 weeks have been the busiest and yet the most rewarding weeks of my life. It’s a bittersweet feeling. Oh, and I did &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-3-the-iron-yard&quot;&gt;eventually&lt;/a&gt; finish our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/surf-and-paddle&quot;&gt;week 3 lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorial day, no class 😢.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy rain caused some ridiculous flooding and freeways were all closed. Needless to say, TIY was closed too 😢.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/houston-flood.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;houston-flood-2015&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yay class! I have been so excited for this week to come. It’s Rails week! But before that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-16/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing too fancy today, just a bit of CSS positioning practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture today is on…Rails! Bet you didn’t see that coming! So excite, much knowledge. Jesse did a quick run through of a basic Rails app with static pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;rails new app_name
rails g controller Pages action1 action2
rails s
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He talked us through a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-16/tree/master/texas&quot;&gt;Texas Cities site&lt;/a&gt;. During the walkthrough, he also went over routes, the gemfile, and the asset pipeline. No models yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we had a review and Jesse ended up doing another talk-through of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-16/tree/master/review&quot;&gt;superhero static pages app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework is to create a basic Rails app with some pages. I made mine about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-16&quot;&gt;animals gifs&lt;/a&gt; because why not.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/dog-pooping.gif&quot; alt=&quot;dog-pooping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-17/blob/master/README.md&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; is some Ruby class review. The interesting thing about this challenge is the introduction of &lt;code&gt;class Date&lt;/code&gt; to help us get the age of a person. I have to admit that I got a little cocky when I read challenge. &lt;code&gt;Date.today.year - @dob.year&lt;/code&gt;, ezpz right? Nope. Doesn’t pass the test because I forgot to account for whether the birthday has already passed or not for the current year. I was eventually able to come up with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-17/person.rb&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; as a solution. I’m pretty sure this solution doesn’t account for leap years and leap birthdays but our 15 minutes were up 😞.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s not static? That’s right, dynamic! Today’s lecture is on dynamic pages in Rails. Jesse took our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-16/tree/master/texas&quot;&gt;static Texas cities&lt;/a&gt; app from yesterday and turned it into an app with dynamic pages. Dynamic pages are way cool. We basically deleted all of our views from the static example and were able to make a single view with changing content. This allows us to generate millions of pages for different products, like Amazon does, with just a handful of views. Dynamic routes are awesome too &lt;code&gt; get &#39;/:post_name&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;pages#show&#39;, as: :post &lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is day 2 of the week but it is still Thursday so of course we still get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-4-lab&quot;&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; 😀. We basically have to take our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/surf-and-paddle&quot;&gt;week 3 lab&lt;/a&gt; and turn it into a Rails app with dynamic pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our guest speaker for the week is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robyfitzhenry&quot;&gt;Roby Fitzhenry&lt;/a&gt;. Roby is a self-made entrepreneur and designer who speaks with passion. He shared his personal story with us and inspired us to follow our passion. One especially interesting moment to me was when someone asked Roby about front end vs back end pay. Roby’s response was that you should do whatever you enjoy. If you enjoy it, you’ll keep doing it and eventually you’ll become great at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roby also explained design in a very human way, simply as a narrative. The most important thing is the story that you are telling. I think that as someone who loves banging away at the keyboard to chip away at technical problems, I sometimes forget what the end goal is. That is that I am building products for humans. How I build and design my applications tell a story to my users. How the story is told is just as important as the story itself. &lt;code&gt;rambling.end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I actually finished the lab this week early and submitted it Thursday evening. Jesse, being the awesome instructor that he is, added nightmare mode Friday morning and made a point to let me know. You have to love it when an instructor adjusts for his students 😀. Since we’re doing Rails now, I’ll start adding both production and code links for Rails apps that I deploy. Week 4 lab: &lt;a href=&quot;https://surf-and-rails.herokuapp.com/&quot;&gt;production&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/surf_and_rails&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not really mobile responsive yet but I do plan on adding that in soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-thoughts&quot;&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rails is awesome. Small things like &lt;code&gt;.parameterize&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.pluralize&lt;/code&gt; really make Rails friendly to use. Ruby and Rails might not be the leanest but the ease of use makes it such a joy to program with. In the end, isn’t that what technology is for? To make life easier? It’s exciting to see how far we’ve come in 4 weeks and I definitely can’t wait to see what we’ll be able to produce by the end of 12 weeks. Next week is database stuff, can’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 3 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;long-weekend&quot;&gt;Long Weekend!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s memorial weekend, yay! Except, I haven’t had a weekend since I started TIY. It doesn’t seem like I’ll have one anytime soon either. I spent all of yesterday trying to migrate out of WordPress. I fixed up my &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeypoon.com&quot;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and moved it to Github pages. It loads so much faster now that it brings a tear to my eyes. I was actually planning to write this blog post yesterday but I ended up spending literally an entire day trying to configure my DNS to get my custom domain working. In the end, I was wasting my time because the settings were fine, my hosting provider was just having some issues. Wonderful timing. If you’ve been following my blog, you’ll notice that it looks a little different now too. That’s because I am now blogging with Jekyll and Atom :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;nerd_level++&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monday&quot;&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-11/triangle_challenge.rb&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt; today is to determine the type of a triangle given the length of its 3 sides. Starting today, our challenges are supposed to be in a new form. We’re given tests and we write code to make it green. I like this change as it forces us to get use to testing. Honestly, this challenge was a little tough for me. I’m not sure why, but I have been having a strange aversion to if/elsif trees. I kept trying to find some elegant loop solution. After wasting enough time, I still ended up using a bunch of if statements (original solution is commented out). Funny enough, my original solution used more if statements and the logic behind the solution is fuzzy at best. I’ll need to work on that weird mentality of mine. Red, Green, Refactor – not Red, Refactor, Green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lecture today is over testing and some HTML/CSS. Jesse walked us through creating a bowling score calculator with TDD. It is interesting to see how even someone as experienced as Jesse backtracks with solutions. While I like the idea of testing, I don’t think I’ll be as zealous about testing every single method. To me, methods are to break things down into manageable parts. If these parts are small enough, it feels almost pointless to test the smaller methods. I also don’t like the idea of not looking at the problem as a whole and just letting TDD guide you. I find that doing so will sometimes waste time by forcing you to rewrite previous solutions. I do like that TDD forces you to write better(?) code but at the same time I think that looking at the problem at a higher-level can help prevent some rewriting down the road (I have opinions, please don’t grab the pitchforks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework is additional review on testing. We had to write code to pass the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-11&quot;&gt;bob_test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tuesday&quot;&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first HTML/CSS &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-12&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The challenge itself is pretty simple, just some practice with HTML and CSS. &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/joeypoon/pen/XbKOmg&quot;&gt;Challenge result&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s lecture is a more in-depth look at HTML and CSS. We were shown the hover element, using background-image + cover, how to tint an image, and SCSS. Not everyone submitted last week’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/BlackJack&quot;&gt;BlackJack lab assignment&lt;/a&gt; so Jesse didn’t assign any homework so that everyone could have some breathing room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wednesday&quot;&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/day-13&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; is to recreate a chess board with pure HTML and CSS. No ERB 😢. This challenge definitely made a lot of use out of copy paste. I didn’t get to &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/joeypoon/pen/VLKvda&quot;&gt;finish&lt;/a&gt; within the time-limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge led perfectly into our lecture topic: Middleman and ERB. (E)mbedded (R)u(B)y allows you to use Ruby within your html file. This is awesome because you no longer need to copy paste 64 divs to make a chess board, just loop. Middleman is interesting because it’s so similar to Rails. Seems almost like Rails integrated Middleman? Asset pipeline and Middleman build is awesome. Use ERB to create your page and just use Middleman build to generate the HTML. We also did review of our lab today. I’m a little guilty of zoning out a little during today’s review but in my defense, I did a lot of reading on Jekyll and Github pages. It’s what inspired me to migrate my blog 😀.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homework today is to create a simple website for yourself. It was left as an optional assignment since our review ran a little long. Being inspired by my Jekyll and Github pages reading, I spent pretty much the entire night trying to make a decent looking website. Deploying to Github pages is ridiculously easy with Jekyll. Middleman is pretty easy too with Middleman deploy but Jekyll still wins in ease of use. It makes sense to teach Middleman over Jekyll in class, however, as it provides a perfect entry point for Rails. I probably should have taken a screenshot of how my site looked but I forgot, sorry 😶.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thursday&quot;&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data parsing is today’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-14&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;. We have to parse through the Gettysburg address and display the number of times each word appeared, minus common words like “the”. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-14&quot;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got excited because I thought it might lead into a little machine learning. It didn’t 😞. It did lead into cool things you could do with .inject though. I don’t think anyone in class used .inject in their solution so that was interesting to see. The major chunk of today’s lecture was over Git and Github. Jesse went over the basic commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m &quot;Message&quot;
$ git remote add origin url
$ git push -u origin master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also showed us what to do if we get stuck in vim or get a merge error. It definitely took me a long time to figure out what was going on the first time I had a merge error or when I forgot my -m so that was useful to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-3-lab&quot;&gt;Lab&lt;/a&gt; this week is to recreate a webpage using HTML/CSS and deploy to Github pages using Middleman. Hard-mode includes making the page responsive (No UI frameworks allowed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;friday&quot;&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s guest speaker is &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RookieOne&quot;&gt;Jonathan Birkholz&lt;/a&gt;. JB runs the Houston-JS meetup group and is an all-around outstanding guy. He gave us tons of encouragement and really drove home the point that as developers, we never stop learning. There are always new technologies being invented and new technologies to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m slacking a little on this week’s lab. I haven’t even looked at it yet. I’m way too absorbed in trying to get a decent looking portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;confessions&quot;&gt;Confessions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having some weird moral guilt about &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/week-2-the-iron-yard-and-my-first-hackathon/&quot;&gt;building Houston.Vote&lt;/a&gt; with WordPress. Near the end of the week, I came to terms that this was a silly thing to feel guilty about. We initially tried to use Rails but we decided that we didn’t know it well enough to finish the product within 24 hours. We were 2 weeks into TIY and we’re still learning. So there you have it. We used WordPress. We still got a working &lt;a href=&quot;http://Houston.vote&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and I am proud of what we did in 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also bought a theme for my &lt;a href=&quot;http://joeypoon.com&quot;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt;. I actually don’t feel guilty about this. The fact is that I’m not a designer, nor do I seek to be. I want to develop back-end logic and understand how to do front-end. I could spend days trying to make a decent looking website or I could spend 10 dollars to buy a way better looking theme. I actually did end up spending a ton of time trying to get the theme to work properly but I’d attribute that to my lack of understanding of Jekyll/Middleman. It was a good learning experience on using Jekyll/Middleman so I’m not unhappy about the time I spent. I know now that if I have to apply another theme, I could do it quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-stuff&quot;&gt;Other Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still having some trouble getting redirects to work properly so unfortunately some links for my blog might be broken but I’ll hopefully have it working soon™. I really need to get started on my lab. I was suppose to have my blog fully migrated midday yesterday but I’m still not completely done. Better hop to it.

        <title>Week 2 The Iron Yard and My First Hackathon</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/hackhou.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;houston-hackathon&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transformation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started dreaming in code a couple months back but it has recently become the dominant form of dreaming for me. I often find myself waking up to arrays and hashes. Earlier this week, I almost asked my girlfriend for an array of what she wanted for dinner so I could call &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;.sample&lt;/span&gt;  on it. Every time she tells me she wants a Corgi, &lt;pre&gt;Corgi.new&lt;/pre&gt; flashes in my head. I find myself unconsciously trying to figure out how to organize daily things into data. I won&#39;t lie, I&#39;m starting to feel a sense of achievement with how nerdy I&#39;m becoming. Just everyday life while attending TIY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Monday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda: Lab review, instance variables, and modules. So apparently I completely forgot to mention the fact that most days start off with a challenge. Monday &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-6/day-6-challenge.rb&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The goal was to, given an array of arrays of integers (yay English), get the sum of each row and the average of all elements. Seems designed to refresh our memories on enumerators. We are only given 15 minutes for challenges at the end of which we are shown how much more efficient Jesse is at programming. The next thirty minutes or so was spent reviewing our &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/week-1-lab&quot;&gt;week 1 lab&lt;/a&gt;. Lecture covering ivars and modules followed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-6/day-6.rb&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-7/day-7-challenge.rb&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. More reviewing enumerators with some classes thrown in. Lecture today was over...testing! Yay. Hopefully I can start to write &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/on-the-road-to-testing/&quot;&gt;less bad tests&lt;/a&gt;. Second half of lecture was over &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;. Today&#39;s assignment was recreating rock, paper, scissors. It was a little tougher than our past homework assignments and had a hard mode. The hardest part for me was thinking of an elegant way to check the winner without writing a huge if tree. I ended up creating a flag attribute and passing in the user&#39;s choice to get the flag value. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-7&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Wednesday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why hello there, Fizzbuzz. We had two challenges this morning, good ole&#39; Fizzbuzz and Palindrome. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/blob/master/day-8/day-8-challenge.rb&quot;&gt;Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Being able to add methods to pre-existing classes is awesome. Lecture today was over array methods(.pop/.shift, etc.). The main point was that some methods mutate the original array whereas others create a new array. Assignments appear to be getting harder and harder. Today&#39;s assignment was to create a program that assigned secret santas. Creating an algorithm for solving the assignment seemed fairly simple but I kept getting unexpected values. After way too much debugging, I realized that I wasn&#39;t creating a new array with equal values. I was simply pointing two variables to the same array. Derp, all I needed was a &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;.dup&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-8&quot;&gt;Homework&lt;/a&gt;. Testing is definitely starting to make a little more sense. The hardest part of TDD for me was knowing what tests to write. Watching Jesse write tests and going through his thought process really helped me understand how I should be thinking. I&#39;m starting to see a difference in the way I approach problems. Having trouble thinking of how to test something? Probably need to rethink your solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Thursday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab assignment day! I love lab assignments (yes, I realize this is only my second one). I&#39;m skipping a little ahead though. Can&#39;t forget the challenges. Today&#39;s challenges were quite interesting. Our first challenge was to write a method that could break a dollar amount down into the least possible number of coins (25, 10, 5, and 1 cents) and to display them in an array, including repeats. My first thought was to use modulo to get the number of times a coin could go into the dollar amount and return the remainder. The solution worked but then I tried to add it to the Fixnum class for fun and it went boom.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/cat_boom.gif&quot; alt=&quot;cat_boom&quot; /&gt;
From what I could tell, it didn&#39;t like me adding ivars into the class? After watching Jesse create his solution, I was able to rework my solution to loop and store the coin denominations into an array directly. Our second challenge was to create a credit card number checker. I never realized that there was maths behind the numbers that determined the validity of the numbers so that was cool to learn. We weren&#39;t actually assigned the second challenge since we spent too much time on the first challenge but my Asian-ness forced me to do it anyways. To check the card numbers we just need to double every other digit in the card, starting from the back, sum every digit together and make sure the total is divisible by 10. A combination of &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;.reverse&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;.map&lt;/span&gt;, looping, &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;.reduce(:+)&lt;/span&gt;, and modulo provided a valid solution. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/iron_yard/tree/master/day-9&quot;&gt;Challenges&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was a little different in that we also had a guest speaker. As soon as we were assigned our lab we crowded into the commons to hear an amazing talk by Justin Richards of Brightblack Data Services. The topic was on natural language processing, machine learning, and Bayes&#39; Theorem. Justin did a quick overview of probability and Bayes&#39; Theorem. He then did a live demo of training a program to rate movie reviews using Python and the NLTK library. I didn&#39;t think I would like data science but this was some pretty awesome stuff. I had to head to work so I unfortunately wasn&#39;t able to stay for everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Friday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab for this week is to re-create &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tiy-hou-q2-2015-rails/week-2-lab&quot;&gt;Blackjack&lt;/a&gt;. For this lab I decided to force myself to adhere to TDD and the red, green, refactor cycle by write tests before implementing. I definitely feel like it helped me organize the program better. I think the most challenging part of this assignment (other than knowing what tests to write) was figuring out where to place my methods. For example, should I put my draw function in the &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;class Player&lt;/span&gt; , &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;class Deck&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class=&quot;lang:ruby decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;class BlackJack&lt;/span&gt;? With a variety of classes, it took a lot of thought to plan out how I wanted the program to flow. A cool feature that I was able to implement was lifetime score tracking through file writing and reading. Even if you close the program and destroy the instance of the game, your score against the dealer would be saved to a file and read back into the game on the next run. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/BlackJack&quot;&gt;BlackJack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guest speaker today was Daniel Goldman of Stackwave. He talked a little about linked lists, trees, parent-child relationships, and DOM. Daniel is pretty awesome at breaking things down to understandable chunks for us newbies. He also hired two devs from the last TIY cohort so that&#39;s pretty awesome. We also bombarded him with questions about his company so got a lot of startup perspective. Definitely an awesome day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Bonus: First Hackathon!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow am I tired. I just finished my first Hackathon and it has been an amazing time. I honestly had no idea what to expect when I went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://houstonhackathon.com/&quot;&gt;3rd annual Houston Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday. I was dealing with a serious case of imposter syndrome. I was worried that I wouldn&#39;t be able to contribute. It was supremely helpful to have someone else to share this feeling with and to keep me accountable (looking at you &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MartinBee&quot;&gt;@MartinBee&lt;/a&gt;). I met some amazing people in the community and had fun while doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event started off with some logistics and a brief speech from Mayor Parker. We had a brief break with some Viet sandwiches and a ridiculous amount of Redbulls. Following the break, people looking for team-members had the chance to pitch their project ideas. This was perfect as I didn&#39;t really have anything in mind. There were some awesome and creative ideas. There were a ton of projects that sounded fun to work on but I was afraid that I wouldn&#39;t be able to contribute to some of the more technically difficult projects at this point in my career (why couldn&#39;t this Hackathon have taken place 6 weeks later :sadface). Fortunately there were so many projects to choose from that this didn&#39;t pose much of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up working with an awesome team trying to make voting more fun and engaging (outline of &lt;a href=&quot;http://challengepost.com/software/houston-vote&quot;&gt;project&lt;/a&gt;). Our goal was to allow visitors of the site to get info on why voting is important and to be able to take a pledge through the site. Pledgers choosing to upload a photo would get their picture superimposed with a check(representing a voting checkbox) and name posted on the site. Users would also be able to easily share this pledger&#39;s &quot;badge&quot; through Facebook and Twitter directly through the site. The idea was that this would help keep pledgers accountable and help generate additional exposure. I don&#39;t know if it is because we were all starving from working at full speed but the pizza provided for dinner was amazing. We worked through about 930pm before we split up to get some rest. It looked like a good half of the attendees planned on staying the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was a race to get the essential features running and scrapping what we couldn&#39;t complete in time. Presentations officially began at noon but we worked through until around 2pm to try to get more features working. You can view the presentations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoFE-cWUpjM&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (our team presents at about 1:38:40). We spent so much time worrying about our features that we forgot to plan out our presentation. We weren&#39;t able to finish everything we wanted to do but I&#39;m pretty happy with what we were able to do in 24 hours. The site is live and you can visit it here: &lt;a href=&quot;http://houston.vote/&quot;&gt;Houston.Vote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been an exhausting week. I imagine it isn&#39;t going to get any less tiring anytime soon. Fortunately, it is an awesome kind of tiring. Met some awesome people, built some amazing programs, and learned a bunch of new things. This has definitely been a productive week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Week 1 The Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;h3&gt;Changes Abound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told myself that I would blog everyday once I started TIY but I&#39;ve already destroyed that dream. From this past week, it seems that I&#39;ll only be able to manage an update per week at most but I&#39;ll do my best. These last two weeks have been big for me. I started TIY this past Monday and I knew that there was no way I could keep my full-time job while attending so last week was my last at my company. I am now unemployed. Well, I was for a weekend. My company liked &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/working-efficiently/&quot;&gt;my programs&lt;/a&gt; so much that they offered me a part-time position working on their website so I started that position on Monday. I honestly wanted to focus solely on TIY but I certainly can&#39;t turn down getting paid to program, I mean that is the dream right? So anyways, I should stop babbling about my life and talk about TIY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Day 1 started with donuts, kolaches, coffee(what day doesn&#39;t?), and introductions. Everyone is super friendly and awesome. We have 19 people total this cohort with 10 in Front-End and 9 in Rails Engineering. Once intros were over, we split up into our classes and dove straight into lecture. For our first lesson, we covered variables, strings, arrays, and hashes. For comparison, I am also taking an intro to CS course at the university and we just barely covered arrays in our final lesson of the semester(yes, it took an entire semester to get to arrays). We get a short break halfway into lecture(have to refill on coffee!). At the end of lecture, we get assigned our homework for the day and then break for lunch. Most of us worked during lunch to complete the homework. Some awesome tacos were provided for lunch. After lunch, we have an as-needed review and lab time. Finishing the pre-work will give you a leg-up on day 1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/joeypoon/d30e8f4f0da4dc046825&quot;&gt;Day 1 homework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing too different on day 2(no lunch though :sadface). On the agenda was enumerables(.map/collect, .reduce/.inject, .select/.reject). &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/joeypoon/e0f4d278f38b5092d625&quot;&gt;Day 2 homework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda: classes, attributes, methods, inheritance, and a hint of polymorphism with duck typing and method overrides. I think this is probably the equalizing day for most of the students. Even if you do the pre-work, you&#39;ll have to be fairly comfortable with OOP concepts to not feel like banging your head against your keyboard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/joeypoon/b28b38dfdbe370a933c6&quot;&gt;Day 3 homework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agenda: blocks, gems, and csv parsing. Let the head smashing begin.
&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/smashing_head_keyboard.gif&quot; alt=&quot;smashing_head_keyboard&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; /&gt;
Today marks our first lab assignment. The difference between a lab assignment and a homework assignment is simply the scale. A lab is meant to take us the entire weekend to complete. The super awesome thing about our lab is that even if you finish it, there is a hard-mode and nightmare-mode. Who doesn&#39;t love a good challenge? Hard-mode doesn&#39;t necessarily require any new techniques, but it does make you think harder and require a good understanding of topics already covered. Nightmare-mode requires teaching yourself things beyond what was taught in class. For this lab, I had to learn about argument vectors and shebangs in order to complete it. I definitely spent more time trying to figure out how to solve nightmare-mode than writing code. I also learned some mandatory soft-skills from Brian and Jesse(pour over coffee and ping-pong). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/week-1-lab&quot;&gt;Week 1 Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Day 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridays are no lecture days. Officially Friday is a lab day, however, we&#39;re supposed to have the occasional guest speaker. Today, we had &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Kevin7Christmas&quot;&gt;Kevin Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/EA_Roa&quot;&gt;Efrain Roa&lt;/a&gt; as guest speakers. Kevin and Efrain are TIY grads who recently got accepted into an accelerator. This was super cool as I am considering trying my hand at a startup after TIY. Hearing their story and encouragement was supremely inspiring. Afterwards, we continued lab time and engaged in group learning. Today was a bit different in that I somehow ended up teaching in front of the class since Jesse had a conference call. Was definitely pretty cool. Stumbled on my words a bit but I definitely felt like it also helped me gain a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Week 1 Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it interesting how this class is structured. Most tutorials I find online typically went data types =&amp;gt; conditionals =&amp;gt; loops =&amp;gt; methods =&amp;gt; classes. We never really formally covered data types and we didn’t even touch if statements until after loops and methods. Not sure what’s more effective but having &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/risky-proposition/&quot;&gt;been teaching myself programming for the past year&lt;/a&gt;, I’m glad that I didn’t have to go through data types in detail again. I think my favorite thing about this experience is the environment. If you’re coming to TIY, you’re probably making a fairly large sacrifice to attend. This creates a level of commitment from the students that I generally don’t see at the university level. Being surrounded by people that are so committed to learning makes learning more awesome and wayyyyy faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: TIY is awesome, the people are awesome, do it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Demystifying Rails</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a busy week at work. I mean, look at how sad this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon&quot;&gt;past week&lt;/a&gt; was. Fortunately, I was able to get my code on this weekend. I took a slight detour from Rails previously to brush up on my Ruby and am now back at Rails. It is so much easier to understand Rails when you know some Ruby. Things are definitely sticking better this time around. Some awesome things I was able to learn this weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, this isn’t specifically Rails but it’s still awesome. Syntactically awesome stylesheets could not be a more appropriate name. Being so use to nesting and variables, it definitely felt like hassle at times trying to write plain css. Yay for Sass!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Partials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is just something so satisfying about breaking down chunky looking code into smaller chunks. Partials are welcome in my code any day. Hopefully I can commit another naming convention to memory (chanting: _partial _partial _partial).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Paths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;get &#39;some_page&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;controller#action&#39;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wondering for a while how to customize urls so learning about paths in Rails was happy times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Asset Pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;rails new my_app&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;creates so many things that understanding where things were took a while. Learning about the asset pipeline was definitely a relief. Having the manifest include everything in the directory is so convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to write &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/on-the-road-to-testing/&quot;&gt;my own tests&lt;/a&gt; and doing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joeypoon/Summer_FA_Calculator&quot;&gt;terrible job&lt;/a&gt;. Rails makes testing so much easier. I’m just starting to grasp the amazing things I can do with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;rake test&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but I definitely feel like I’m getting closer to TDD. Thank you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;validates&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;assert&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Regex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I honestly still don’t get regex. I’ve had to use regex in a couple of solutions before but I was able to find a suitable answer online so I didn’t bother learning how to write one on my own. I’m going to do it this time. I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a great weekend :).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Journey to the Iron Yard</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/img/tiy-austin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/tiy-austin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;iron-yard&quot; class=&quot;alignnone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As May the Fourth approaches (what a wonderful coincidence), I find myself unable to contain my excitement for &lt;a href=&quot;http://theironyard.com/courses/&quot;&gt;the Iron Yard&lt;/a&gt;. So instead of imploding, I have decided to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-beginning&quot;&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than two years ago, I was &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/a-new-love/&quot;&gt;studying for law school&lt;/a&gt;. Today, I don’t know where my LSAT practice books are and instead I find myself &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/everyone-should-learn-to-program/&quot;&gt;writing programs for work and for fun&lt;/a&gt;. When I first started learning how to program, I scoured the internet for resources and devoured them. After a while, I felt like my learning had slowed down. I finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/learn&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; and some books from Big Nerd Ranch but I still felt lost when I tried to create something from scratch. I began looking into different options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Fork With One Road&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first options that came up was to attend a programming bootcamp. The mere idea of an intensive full-time programming bootcamp excited me. Unfortunately, it was not financially feasible for me at the time so I begrudgingly crossed it off my list of possibilities. I had already finished my Bachelor degree so the next logical step would have been a Master program. My degree was non-technical, however, so the number of pre-reqs I needed to start graduate level courses meant an addition two years on top of the degree length. With this in mind, I resigned myself to getting a second Bachelor. I might as well get a degree if I have to take the pre-reqs right? What was I to do? I ran into what felt like an insurmountable wall just trying to self-learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Flames Reignited&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time passed and classes started. It would take me a while to get my degree but I didn’t feel like I had any other options. Some things happened and my girlfriend ended up moving in with me. I didn’t think much of it at the time. One day my now routine googling for programming resources led me to an article that talked about different types of education options for aspiring developers. One of the options was of course the programming bootcamp. I followed the link and ended up with a list of programming bootcamps. I glance over some. They were nice and exciting but most of them were in SF and NY which made them far too expensive due to additional living costs. Out of curiosity, I did a control+f for Houston to see if there were any nearby. To my surprise, I found the Iron Yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Awesomeness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With TIY being in town, this cut the cost of attendance significantly. This is further compounded by my now reduced living expenses since my girlfriend shared living costs with me. For the first time, programming bootcamp seemed like a possibility. Being the awesome girlfriend that she is, Nicky told me that she would support my decision if I decided to quit my job and attend TIY. I had no more excuses. I emailed Brian to set up a visit and the rest is &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/risky-proposition/&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Excitement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I was excited when I first realized that I could actually attend TIY, however, I am somehow still getting more excited by the day. I stopped by TIY this past Wednesday for their crash course and I was reminded of why I wanted to go to TIY. Sure you could take your time to learn this stuff at home but I’m just as excited about the atmosphere and the people as I am about the learning. Let the countdown begin!&lt;/p&gt;
