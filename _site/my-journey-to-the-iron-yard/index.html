<p>As May the Fourth approaches (what a wonderful coincidence), I find myself unable to contain my excitement for <a href="http://theironyard.com/courses/">the Iron Yard</a>. So instead of imploding, I have decided to write about it.</p>

<h3 id="the-beginning">The Beginning</h3>
<p>Less than two years ago, I was <a href="http://joeypoon.com/blog/2015/02/08/a-new-love/">studying for law school</a>. Today, I don’t know where my LSAT practice books are and instead I find myself <a href="http://joeypoon.com/blog/2015/04/10/everyone-should-learn-to-program/">writing programs for work and for fun</a>. When I first started learning how to program, I scoured the internet for resources and devoured them. After a while, I felt like my learning had slowed down. I finished <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> and some books from Big Nerd Ranch but I still felt lost when I tried to create something from scratch. I began looking into different options.</p>

<h3>The Fork With One Road</h3>
<p>One of the first options that came up was to attend a programming bootcamp. The mere idea of an intensive full-time programming bootcamp excited me. Unfortunately, it was not financially feasible for me at the time so I begrudgingly crossed it off my list of possibilities. I had already finished my Bachelor degree so the next logical step would have been a Master program. My degree was non-technical, however, so the number of pre-reqs I needed to start graduate level courses meant an addition two years on top of the degree length. With this in mind, I resigned myself to getting a second Bachelor. I might as well get a degree if I have to take the pre-reqs right? What was I to do? I ran into what felt like an insurmountable wall just trying to self-learn.</p>

<h3>Flames Reignited</h3>
<p>Time passed and classes started. It would take me a while to get my degree but I didn’t feel like I had any other options. Some things happened and my girlfriend ended up moving in with me. I didn’t think much of it at the time. One day my now routine googling for programming resources led me to an article that talked about different types of education options for aspiring developers. One of the options was of course the programming bootcamp. I followed the link and ended up with a list of programming bootcamps. I glance over some. They were nice and exciting but most of them were in SF and NY which made them far too expensive due to additional living costs. Out of curiosity, I did a control+f for Houston to see if there were any nearby. To my surprise, I found the Iron Yard.</p>

<h3>The Awesomeness</h3>
<p>With TIY being in town, this cut the cost of attendance significantly. This is further compounded by my now reduced living expenses since my girlfriend shared living costs with me. For the first time, programming bootcamp seemed like a possibility. Being the awesome girlfriend that she is, Nicky told me that she would support my decision if I decided to quit my job and attend TIY. I had no more excuses. I emailed Brian to set up a visit and the rest is <a href="http://joeypoon.com/2015/02/17/risky-proposition/">history</a>.</p>

<h3>Excitement</h3>
<p>I thought I was excited when I first realized that I could actually attend TIY, however, I am somehow still getting more excited by the day. I stopped by TIY this past Wednesday for their crash course and I was reminded of why I wanted to go to TIY. Sure you could take your time to learn this stuff at home but I’m just as excited about the atmosphere and the people as I am about the learning. Let the countdown begin!</p>
