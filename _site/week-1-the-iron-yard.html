				<h3>Changes Abound</h3>
<p>I told myself that I would blog everyday once I started TIY but I've already destroyed that dream. From this past week, it seems that I'll only be able to manage an update per week at most but I'll do my best. These last two weeks have been big for me. I started TIY this past Monday and I knew that there was no way I could keep my full-time job while attending so last week was my last at my company. I am now unemployed. Well, I was for a weekend. My company liked <a href="/blog/working-efficiently.html">my programs</a> so much that they offered me a part-time position working on their website so I started that position on Monday. I honestly wanted to focus solely on TIY but I certainly can't turn down getting paid to program, I mean that is the dream right? So anyways, I should stop babbling about my life and talk about TIY.</p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>So Day 1 started with donuts, kolaches, coffee(what day doesn't?), and introductions. Everyone is super friendly and awesome. We have 19 people total this cohort with 10 in Front-End and 9 in Rails Engineering. Once intros were over, we split up into our classes and dove straight into lecture. For our first lesson, we covered variables, strings, arrays, and hashes. For comparison, I am also taking an intro to CS course at the university and we just barely covered arrays in our final lesson of the semester(yes, it took an entire semester to get to arrays). We get a short break halfway into lecture(have to refill on coffee!). At the end of lecture, we get assigned our homework for the day and then break for lunch. Most of us worked during lunch to complete the homework. Some awesome tacos were provided for lunch. After lunch, we have an as-needed review and lab time. Finishing the pre-work will give you a leg-up on day 1. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeypoon/d30e8f4f0da4dc046825">Day 1 homework</a>.</p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>
<p>Nothing too different on day 2(no lunch though :sadface). On the agenda was enumerables(.map/collect, .reduce/.inject, .select/.reject). <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeypoon/e0f4d278f38b5092d625">Day 2 homework</a>.</p>

<h3>Day 3</h3>
<p>Agenda: classes, attributes, methods, inheritance, and a hint of polymorphism with duck typing and method overrides. I think this is probably the equalizing day for most of the students. Even if you do the pre-work, you'll have to be fairly comfortable with OOP concepts to not feel like banging your head against your keyboard. <a href="https://gist.github.com/joeypoon/b28b38dfdbe370a933c6">Day 3 homework</a>.</p>

<h3>Day 4</h3>
<p>Agenda: blocks, gems, and csv parsing. Let the head smashing begin.

Today marks our first lab assignment. The difference between a lab assignment and a homework assignment is simply the scale. A lab is meant to take us the entire weekend to complete. The super awesome thing about our lab is that even if you finish it, there is a hard-mode and nightmare-mode. Who doesn't love a good challenge? Hard-mode doesn't necessarily require any new techniques, but it does make you think harder and require a good understanding of topics already covered. Nightmare-mode requires teaching yourself things beyond what was taught in class. For this lab, I had to learn about argument vectors and shebangs in order to complete it. I definitely spent more time trying to figure out how to solve nightmare-mode than writing code. I also learned some mandatory soft-skills from Brian and Jesse(pour over coffee and ping-pong). <a href="https://github.com/joeypoon/week-1-lab">Week 1 Lab</a>.</p>

<h3>Day 5</h3>
<p>Fridays are no lecture days. Officially Friday is a lab day, however, we're supposed to have the occasional guest speaker. Today, we had <a href="https://twitter.com/Kevin7Christmas">Kevin Cruz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/EA_Roa">Efrain Roa</a> as guest speakers. Kevin and Efrain are TIY grads who recently got accepted into an accelerator. This was super cool as I am considering trying my hand at a startup after TIY. Hearing their story and encouragement was supremely inspiring. Afterwards, we continued lab time and engaged in group learning. Today was a bit different in that I somehow ended up teaching in front of the class since Jesse had a conference call. Was definitely pretty cool. Stumbled on my words a bit but I definitely felt like it also helped me gain a better understanding.</p>

<h3>Week 1 Thoughts</h3>
<p>I find it interesting how this class is structured. Most tutorials I find online typically went data types =&gt; conditionals =&gt; loops =&gt; methods =&gt; classes. We never really formally covered data types and we didn’t even touch if statements until after loops and methods. Not sure what’s more effective but having <a href="/blog/risky-proposition.html">been teaching myself programming for the past year</a>, I’m glad that I didn’t have to go through data types in detail again. I think my favorite thing about this experience is the environment. If you’re coming to TIY, you’re probably making a fairly large sacrifice to attend. This creates a level of commitment from the students that I generally don’t see at the university level. Being surrounded by people that are so committed to learning makes learning more awesome and wayyyyy faster.</p>

<p>TLDR: TIY is awesome, the people are awesome, do it.</p>
