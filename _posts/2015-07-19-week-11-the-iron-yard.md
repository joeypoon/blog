### Impending End and Beginning
Time passes far too fast. I honestly can't believe that my time as an Iron Yard student is coming to an end. It feels like just yesterday that I started learning Ruby. Today, building and deploying full stack Rails apps is an everyday fact. Thanks to the Jesse and everyone at the Iron Yard, I can now call myself a software engineer. That's right, this past week I received and accepted an offer to be a full-time software engineer. It has been a long journey from my first line of html over a year and a half ago and on Monday I will start a new journey. I look forward to what I will learn in the next year and a half.

### Project Update
So much sadness and happiness but we're not quite there yet. With my start date on Monday, we have one less week to finish our final project. Fortunately we made some breakthroughs this week. Look at this beauty:

Category tags and user follows are easy with gems.

This is the first time I had to create multiple relationships by hand. The hard part isn't actually writing them, however. The hard part is figuring out the best way to structure your models. Users have contact information and locations that they need to share to other users. This is only complicated by the need for

### Other Stuff
Since I start on Monday, I won't be able to attend Iron Yard for the final week. I plan on being there for demo day and will be fine-tuning our final project throughout the evenings.
