<p>I have learned a lot from programming. The funny thing is, a lot of what I learned has nothing to do with programming itself. Like a lot of people, I got by life just going through the motions. I took my AP classes, took my SAT, went to college, and prepared to get into grad school. Honestly, I was never excited about the whole process. I rarely had a class that I enjoyed fully, group projects were a pain, and talking to others about my major felt really tedious. I thought I was just weird or maybe everyone else was trying to pretend like they were having fun. Then I discovered programming.</p>

<h3>Learning can be fun</h3>
<p>It was a strange sensation. I found myself voluntarily googling for information. If I read something that I didn't understand, I would google that. If that led to something that I didn't understand, I would google again. As I became more engrossed with programming, I noticed that my leisure time slowly evolved into learning time. I spent less and less time doing "unproductive" things like scanning Flipboard or watching Netflix. I would instead keep trying to make time to go back and solve that coding challenge I had open. At some point, I came to realize that for the first time ever, I enjoyed learning.</p>

<h3>Socializing can be fun</h3>
<p>I've never been a social animal. I felt like I always had to constantly wear a mask and pretend like I was interested in whatever I was asking and talking about. I just chalked it up to my introversion. When I began meeting other programmers, this changed. I actually wanted to know about them. I wanted to know their story. I wanted to know what they were doing and how they were doing it. People suddenly became awesome.</p>

<h3>Working with others can be fun</h3>
<p>This is similar to socializing but my negative feelings for group projects are so strong that I had to give it it's own section. I hated group projects. I cannot emphasize that enough. For some reason, it always felt like the majority of the group didn't care about the project. This is not true with the people that I've met since I began programming, however. They love what they do and they want to be amazing at what they do. I cannot explain how much I love this mentality. I actually find myself excited to work with other people. There's just something about software development that makes people awesome human beings.
It took me far longer than I expected but I've finally found what I want to do and it feels amazing.</p>
