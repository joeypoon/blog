### A look back
I think the questions that most programming bootcamp students will have at one point or another can be condensed into:

1. Is this really worth the money?
2. Will this help me get my foot in the door (read: job)?
3. Is this actually going prepare me for a career in software?

I talked about whether TIY has been worth the money for me during <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/week-6-the-iron-yard" target="\_blank">week 6</a>. And just to make it more quantifiable, I will add that I paid 12k for the course and got a 16k bump in pay. I talked about my process of getting a job during <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/week-10-the-iron-yard" target="\_blank">week 10</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/week-11-the-iron-yard" target="\_blank">week 11</a>. The third question probably won't become a concern until later in a bootcamp's program, likely when imposter syndrome really starts to set in, but it has been a very real concern of mine until recently. Finishing up my second week as a new software engineer, I feel like I can now comfortably provide insight on the last question.

### Fake it until you become it
Even when you graduate, you will feel like a fake. Your interviewers will ask you about words and concepts that you have never heard of before. You will think that you bombed. This is normal. The fact is that you cannot know everything and you will not know everything. Don't be afraid to ask for clarification or for a question to be rephrased. Often times what you're being asked is simply words that you don't yet know for something that you've been doing for the last 3 months.

The first question for my very first dev interview was to explain ORMs. Object-relational mapping, sounds super complicated right? Actually, that's just the theory stuff behind active record and you've been using it ever since you've learned Rails. I sure as heck didn't know what it was back then. My answer was terrible and I knew I bombed. To my surprise, I was asked to do a second round interview. I don't know whether or not I would have gotten through the second round because I had accepted an offer with another company but the point is that you're not expected to know everything. You will most certainly be expected to be able to learn what's needed, however.

### Be teachable
What this means is that it is actually more important for you to show how teachable you are. Considering that you just spent every waking hour for the last 3 months of your life learning how to program, being genuine is probably a good bet. I mean, during my interview with my current employer, I was asked about my experience with AngularJS and complicated data models. I had no experience with AngularJS and my data models have been fairly simple. However, I let them know: I started learning Rails recently and you can see how fast I learn. I made sure to also point out that I learned and implemented React into my Rails project within a weekend.

The truth is: the intensive time you spend learning at bootcamp is probably more intense than any additional learning you will need for a job. When I looked at the code that I would be responsible for maintaining and improving, it was miles above what I had been working with. The schema was more than 10 times longer than the most complicated schemas that I have built, that's not even mentioning all the various associations that the models had with each other. But, it doesn't matter. I learned how to break problems down into smaller problems. I learned how to sequentially step through a program to see what does what. I learned how to learn.

### Putting it all together
I didn't know how to do my job on my first day. I knew how to change that though. I spent my first couple days grinding code school, documentation, and digging through the code base. I was actually able to learn CoffeeScript, AngularJS, and a lot more Rails. As much Rails as we learned in Iron Yard, it's amazing to see how much more complex Rails actually gets. I was given my first feature to implement on my fourth day and because I knew what to study, I was able to get a basic working version within the day. I had my first code review at the end of my second week and let's just say that I get to keep my job :wink:

If you work hard during bootcamp, you will be rewarded. I have zero regrets and I can now confidently say that the Iron Yard has prepared me well for a career in software engineering.

### Other stuff
In case you're curious, we are moving ahead with commercializing our final project. Here's a very bad and outdated <a href="http://joeypoon.com/admi/" target="\_blank">video and landing page</a>. The API for the mailing list works so you can actually sign up for updates on the project. We're working on updating the landing page, recording an updated video, and getting a domain. In fact, don't watch that video until we update it because it looks like crap compared to its current state.

If you're curious about the new job, it's super awesome great. I've probably gained a couple pounds from all the free food and I'm constantly caffeinated. It's terrible, I know, but it's awesome. They're super cool and flexible with schedules which is great for vampires like me. They got me a shiny new souped up mac book pro to jam code away on if I want to do a little work remotely. In the office, I get to plug my MBP into a 31 inch monitor with a nice window view of the main street. We actually just had a company party yesterday complete with a smash bros tournament and ridiculously generous raffle prizes. This is how to keep your employees happy. Life is good :smile:
