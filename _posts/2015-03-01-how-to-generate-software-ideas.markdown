<p>So this morning I saw the above on Twitter.  This is interesting because for the longest time, I would spent pointless hours a day racking my head trying to think of software ideas.  I would theorize about what perfect app I could make to solve world hunger or bring world peace.  What can I create to make everyone's lives more comfortable?  After I decide that I've wasted enough time just theorizing, I inevitably return to whatever online lesson I'm working on.  I follow along with the lesson and create an app to the lesson's specifications.  But not really.</p>

<p>I noticed that every single time I write code that a lesson or tutorial asks me to, I always do it slightly different than instructed.  Maybe I'm right or maybe I'm wrong, but every time I'm asked to do something, I always feel like something can be better.  And so I usually take it upon myself to add whatever modifications I see fit.  Usually sometime during the process of making my modifications, I end up with some other idea for modification.  This then leads to another and so on.

To give you a recent example, I'm currently taking the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/#/">Complete Web Dev Course</a> on Udemy (Pretty awesome course, btw).  During the JavaScript section of the course, we are asked to build a very simple game to test your reaction speed by clicking randomly colored circles and squares.  When I completed the challenge, it felt incomplete.  It felt annoying as a user that I didn't know what general area the shapes would appear in so I added a border.  I then felt irked that the game had no actual end.  I went ahead and added a 30 second timer and returned your average reaction time at the end.  In the end, this cycle continued and I ended up adding a bunch more things and still want to add a bunch more things (If you're curious, you can find the current version <a href="https://github.com/joeypoon/speed_game">here</a>).</p>

<p>This little game certainly isn't going to end world hunger or bring world peace but it certainly has kept the ideas flowing in my head.  Maybe one day I'll be able to come up with an amazing idea out of thin air, but until then, starting with something simple and making minor improvements to it seems to be more effective at generating ideas.</p>
