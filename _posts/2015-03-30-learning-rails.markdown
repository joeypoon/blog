<p>Back from vacation (<a href="http://nickydisla.com/spring-break-15/">Video </a>if you're interested) and while I enjoyed every minute of it, I can't even begin to describe how itchy my fingers are to code.  So with my Rails Engineering course at the <a href="http://theironyard.com/">Iron Yard</a> beginning in May, I recently started learning some Ruby and Rails.  I'm currently working on the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and having finished the chapter on static pages, I decided to try deploying my <a href="https://github.com/joeypoon/speed_game">speed game</a> through Heroku.  The result was a mixed bag.  I was pretty excited that it worked.  However, I could only get it to work with internal JS and I certainly don't want to be deploying apps in the future with the JS exposed like that.  Oddly enough, making the CSS external was simple enough.  Rails is still feeling too magical, better get back to reading.</p>
