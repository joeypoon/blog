<p>Over the past year or so, I have been teaching myself programming using mostly the internet and some books.  The amount of knowledge I have gained during this time is amazing.  I feel nothing but absolute confidence when solving problems on the internet.  However, if there is one thing that I have been struggling with, it is translating that knowledge into an actual product.  And if there's one thing that I need in order to become a full-time developer, I'd venture to say that ability to create an actual product is pretty important.  All the code in the world is useless unless I can actually do something with it.</p>

<p>Enter <a href=" http://theironyard.com/">the Iron Yard</a>.  While looking over degree and online options, I stumbled across what some people were calling coding bootcamps.  An immersive 60 hour per week environment that lasted an average of 9-12 weeks.  I immediately fell in love with the idea.  Doing nothing but programming for 3 months?  Sign me up.  Luckily for me, the Iron Yard is about to start a mobile engineering program in Houston.  Unfortunately, however, making such a commitment isn't quite so simple.  Rent, bills, and student loan payments don't simply go away.  There's also no doubt that I would have to leave my stable full-time job.  That's certainly a risky proposition for an additional 12k of debt and only the prospect of a job afterwards.</p>

<p>Given such a proposition, I did what any netizen would do: more research.  I scheduled a visit for this morning to see if considering the program was even an option.  It was everything I hoped for (Okay, maybe an unlimited buffet would be nice).  Students were eager to learn and the instructor was full of enthusiasm.  Nobody was just going through the motions, everyone who was there wanted to be there.  That was when I knew, I wanted to be there as well.  If you're looking for a job, it certainly may be a risky proposition.  However, if you're looking for a career, I think it's closer to a blessing.  I hope to see you soon, Iron Yard.</p>
